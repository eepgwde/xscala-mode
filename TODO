weaves

There's a problem with comint send buffer after a paste. I have to send eof twice.

I've added some short keystrokes to the minor mode. C-c C-c and C-c C-e to make stepping
easier.

There's an issue with two menus appearing. I managed to remove the second XScala, but
the inferior mode menu still appears twice.

I haven't put the spacemacs wrapper in.
